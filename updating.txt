# FROG CMS - INFORMATION ABOUT UPDATING


## General ##

Please be aware that we only support single version upgrades. That means you
upgrade from 0.9.3 to 0.9.4 and only then to 0.9.5.

If you're upgrading from a pre-0.9.4 release, consider installing from scratch.

Please be aware that all Frog 0.9.4 plugins except the core plugins will require
some minor updates to work with Frog 0.9.5. Please check with the plugin authors
for updated plugins.


## UPDATING FROM 0.9.4 to 0.9.5 ##

WARNING - The split between frontend and backend in the Frog code has been
          removed in this version. This has led to significant code and path
          changes.

          You will need to update *ALL* files.

Please remember to MAKE BACKUPS of Frog and your DB before trying to update!
The upgrade sequence described below will remove all the old files. Be sure to
have a full backup!


## UPGRADE STEPS ##

Note: consider testing this upgrade process on a local test system before
      upgrading your production system.

1. Create a FULL backup of your database. (structure and data)

2. Create a FULL backup of your files.

3. Download and unzip Frog 0.9.5 to a temporary directory.

4. Remove the following files/directories from your temporary 0.9.5 directory:
    - The "public" directory.
    - The config.php file.

5. Remove ALL the files of your old Frog 0.9.4 installation EXCEPT the "public"
   directory. (and except any custom files you may have added offcourse)

6. Copy/upload ALL files from the temporary directory to your old 0.9.4 Frog
   installation's directory.

7. Copy over the original config.php file.

8. Run the following SQL commands on your Frog database after adding a prefix to
   the table names if necessary:

    ### NOTE: MYSQL commands, but SQLite commands should be almost the same.

    CREATE TABLE `plugin_settings` (
      `plugin_id` varchar(40) NOT NULL,
      `name` varchar(40) NOT NULL,
      `value` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
      UNIQUE KEY `plugin_setting_id` (plugin_id,name)
    ) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;

    ALTER TABLE `page`
        ADD `needs_login` tinyint(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0' COMMENT '' AFTER is_protected;

    ALTER TABLE `setting`
        MODIFY `value` text NOT NULL DEFAULT '' COMMENT '' COLLATE utf8_general_ci;

9. Enable the new htaccess file by removing the underscore.

10. Check the new htaccess file settings against your old htaccess file.

11. Lastly, you need to add some options to the config.php file that were added
    in Frog 0.9.5:

    // Should Frog check for updates on Frog itself and the installed plugins?
    define('CHECK_UPDATES', true);

    // The number of seconds before the check for a new Frog version times out in case of problems.
    define('CHECK_TIMEOUT', 3);

12. That should be it! Test out your new Frog 0.9.5 system.
    Remember to remove the write permissions from config.php, otherwise, Frog
    will complain.

## NOTES ##

- The plugin system was changed in Frog 0.9.5 so download and install plugins
  that are compatible with Frog 0.9.5.

- The public directory now contains a themes subdirectory.
  It is advised that all themes for Frog follow the same approach as the
  Normal theme.

- It is advised to always use the htaccess file. You can dis/enable the url
  rewriting by setting RewriteEngine to On/Off.
